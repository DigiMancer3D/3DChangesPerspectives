## Graphical Overlays

### These are graphical overlays designed to be left on-screen or to be updated as events happen throughout the stream. This can be a great way to give information to your audiance even for replay audiance (the audiance you can not directly interact with). Having an graphic or sticker to tell your audiance the goal of the stream, info of the segment or even what part of your game run you may be in. If you talk about the sticker during your stream, then even replay audiance members can feel like they are apart of the stream any point of time later.

#### The folders are sets of overlay graphics that should be used in conjunction. Folders are for time or event based changable stickers to show a change in events for the better as the stream goes on.
